                <p>Master Chief John-117 (usually referred to by his rank) was kidnapped at the age of 6 by the secretive 
                UNSC agency ONI (Office of Naval Intelligence) after medical tests showed his neural activity was compatible
                with the experimental MJOLLNIR armor engineered as part of the SPARTAN-II program.</p>
                <p>Along with 74 other children 
                of the same age group, they were forced into a hard life of physical and mental training, as well as various bodily 
                augmentations to both improve physical performance and heighten compatiblity with MJOLLNIR suits. While he usually 
                operates on the field as part of Blue Team, most of the games showcase him as working without any fellow SPARTAN-II's.

                <div class = "title" >Cortana</div> 
                <p>Cortana is a "smart" AI, and the first of her kind. Unlike other AI developed by the UNSC, Cortana has her own personality and
                acts akin to a human. Her original personality is a copy of her creator Dr. Halsey, who was also a key figure in the SPARTAN 
                program.</p> 
                <p>
                Her technological capabilities are unparalleled, from infiltrating alien starships to storing the entirety of Alpha Halo's 
                data. She can interface with virtually any computer, including the ones built into MJOLLNIR armor, and both communicate over radio
                and project herself as a small hologram.

                <p>Thel'Vadam is a member of the Sangheli race of the Covenant (usually referred to by UNSC soldiers as "Elites"), and was tasked with
                the safekeeping of Alpha Halo. After the superweapon was destroyed at the end of Halo: Combat Evolved, the Covenant deemed him a heretic
                for failing to protect this vital artifact. While he was given a death sentence for heresy, he was in secret offered the title of "Arbiter",
                a line of historic figures sent out on suicidal missions that required stealthy, highly skilled operatives. </p> 
                <p>
                Upon his travels he met the "Oracle",in actuality the Monitor Guilty Spark-117 of Alpha Halo, who shared with him the truth of the Halo rings' destructive purpose. This revelation
                led to a schism in The Covenant with the Sangheli leaving to ally with humanity, and the Arbiter fighting alongside Master Chief.

                <p>Guilty Spark 343 is an AI created by the Forerunners to act as Monitor of Installation 04, also known as Alpha Halo. Its purpose is to ensure the
                maintenance of Alpha Halo, containment of Flood specimens, and activation of its firing sequence in the case of a Flood outbreak. After the destruction 
                of Alpha Halo it is found by members of the Covenant, and is worshipped as an "Oracle", before it shares the true nature of Halo. Guilty Spark houses no 
                ill intentions, and is seeking only to fulfill its preprogrammed instructions. </p>

                expending incredible amounts of resources in the hopes of preventing the extinction of mankind. </p><p>They also formed the covert Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI),
                which placed humanity's survival over individual rights or moderate loss of human life. This directly led to the creation of the SPARTAN program and Cortana,
                and by extension the defeat of the Covenant and eradication of the Flood.</p>

                The Covenant are a warmongering religion worshipping relics made by The Forerunners, not truly understanding the makers or their creations. The Covenant are comprised

                <ul>
                <li>San'Shyuum ("Prophets")</li>

                their caste system. During the Schism at the very end of the Human-Covenant War, the Sangheili abandoned the Covenant and took up arms alongside the humans to stop

                <p>The main Halo saga takes place across a war raging from the years 2525 and 2552. Humanity is stuggling to survive
                genocide by a religious empire of various alien species known as "The Covenant", who are seeking out artifacts 
                from an ancient civilization known only as "The Forerunners".</p> <p>Head among these religious icons are the Halo rings, which the Covenant
                believe will complete "The Great Journey" and bring salvation. However, the true design for these artificial ringworlds was that of mass
                annihilation, as the combined activation of the Halo rings would purge the entirety of the galaxy of life. 
                The rings were designed to do so to wipe out a superparasite known as "The Flood" to prevent it from contaminating all life in the universe.

                <p>The first entry in the franchise was the video game Halo: Combat Evolved, developed by Bungie Studios and 
                published by Microsoft in 2001 as a killer app for their new console, the Xbox. Its combination of compelling storytelling,
                unique gameplay, and an unprecedented multiplayer experience made it a massive success, and it would later be compiled 
                with other games in the series as part of the Master Chief Collection on Xbox One and PC.</p> <p>This spawned a massive franchise
                consisting of games, books, comics, and animation. The latest game entry, Halo: Infinite is set to release on December 8, 2021,
                and will follow a post-war storyline where Master Chief must face a new alien group called the Banished across the ringworld Zeta Halo.</p>
